        <h3>Logic gate</h3>
        <p>
            It is an idealized or physical device implementing a Boolean function; that is, it performs a logical operation on one or more binary inputs and produces a single binary output.
        </p>
        <h3>ASCII code</h3>
        <p>
            It stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange. Computers can only understand numbers, so it is the numerical representation of a character such as 'a' or '@' or an action of some sort.

        <h3>RAM Random-access memory</h3>
        <p>It is a form of computer data storage which stores frequently used program instructions to increase the general speed of a system. It can be randomly accessed. Data items to be read or written in almost the same amount of time irrespective of
            the physical location of data inside the memory.</p>
        <h3>Programming language</h3>
        <p>A formal language that specifies a set of instructions that can be used to produce various kinds of output. They generally consist of instructions for a computer and can be used to create programs that implement specific algorithms.</p>
        <h3>DNS Domain Name System</h3>
        <p>A hierarchical decentralized naming system for computers, services, or other resources connected to the Internet or a private network. It associates various information with domain names assigned to each of the participating entities.</p>
